ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Project Overview
Project Overview
This capstone project implements a database-powered Patient Appointment Management System using Oracle 21c and PL/SQL. The system streamlines appointment scheduling, maintains medical history, and manages notifications to reduce missed appointments and improve patient care.
Problem Definition
-------------------
1.Manual Inefficiencies: Paper or spreadsheet scheduling causes overlaps or forgotten appointments.
2.Poor Follow-Up: Patients miss visits due to lack of reminders or communication.
3.Data Fragmentation: Medical records and appointment logs are not integrated.
4.Resource Waste: Doctors may be underbooked or overwhelmed due to lack of scheduling control.
Project Goals and Target Users
-------------------------------
Goals
-------
1.Automate appointment booking and tracking using a secure PL/SQL database.
2.Integrate doctor, patient, and appointment data for seamless interaction.
3.Maintain medical records and audit logs with database-level triggers.
4.Improve patient care through timely, consistent reminders.
Target Users
---------------
1.Doctors & Hospitals â€“ Managing daily patient flow and schedules.
2.Patients â€“ Booking or rescheduling appointments.
3.Medical Staff â€“ Accessing medical records.
4.Admins â€“ Monitoring system activities and logs.

 Phase 2: Process Automation with BPMN & Swimlane
 ------------------------------------------------------
Project Scope
----------------
This phase involves creating an end-to-end scheduling and record-keeping system that integrates:
1.Patient data
2.Doctor availability
3.Appointment logic
4.Real-time system logs and restrictions
Anticipated Results
-----------------------
1.Automated scheduling and rescheduling logic
2.Accurate visit history and medical logs
3.Fewer missed appointments due to real-time reminders
4.Secure logging and DML restrictions to ensure reliability
